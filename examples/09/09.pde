        1 = FLAT: Unsurfable or flat conditions. No surf.
        2 = VERY POOR: Due to lack of surf, very poor wave shape for surfing, bad surf due to other conditions like wind, tides, or very stormy surf.
        3 = POOR: Poor surf with some (30%) FAIR waves to ride.
        4 = POOR to FAIR: Generally poor surf many (50%) FAIR waves to ride.
        5 = FAIR: Very average surf with most (70%) waves rideable.
        6 = FAIR to GOOD: Fair surf with some (30%) GOOD waves.
        7 = GOOD: Generally fair surf with many (50%) GOOD waves.
        8 = VERY GOOD: Generally good surf with most (70%) GOOD waves.
        9 = GOOD to EPIC: Very good surf with many (50%) EPIC waves.
        10 = EPIC: Incredible surf with most (70%) waves being EPIC to ride and generally some of the best surf all year.
